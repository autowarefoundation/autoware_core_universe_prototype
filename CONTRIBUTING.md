# Contributing

## Code of conduct

We welcome contributions from everyone, and to ensure our community stays open and healthy
we adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a widely
used [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adopted by many other communities such as
Linux, Ruby on Rails, and GitLab.

Everyone participating in the Autoware community is expected to follow the code of conduct.

If someone in the community happens to be violating these terms, please let the project
leads know, and we will address it as soon as possible.

## License

Autoware is licensed under Apache License 2.0, and thus all contributions will be licensed as such
as per clause 5 of the Apache License 2.0:

```text
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
```

Here is an example copyright header to add to the top of a new file:

```text
Copyright [first year of contribution] The Autoware Contributors
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

We don't write copyright notations of each contributor here.
Instead, we place them in the `NOTICE` file like the following.

```text
This product includes code developed by [company name].
Copyright [first year of contribution] [company name]
```

Please let us know if your legal department has a special request for the copyright notation.

Currently, the old formats explained [here](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/blob/87c5e5880a18068116dd886ad56e1bfc29e694c4/CONTRIBUTING.md) are also acceptable.
Those old formats can be replaced by this new format if the original authors agree,
please note that we won't write their copyrights to the `NOTICE` file unless they agree with the new format.
